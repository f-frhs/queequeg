<h3>What's It?</h3>

<p> Queequeg is a tiny English grammar checker for non-native
speakers who are not used to verb conjugation and number
agreement.  We especially focus on people who're writing academic
papers or business documents where thorough checking is required.
We aim to reduce this laborious work with automated checking.
Queequeg is named after a character in Herman Melville's
masterpiece.

<h3>Sample Run</h3>

Suppose you wrote the following sentences:

<blockquote class=gray><pre>
Paraphrases plays an important role in the variety and complexity
of natural language documents. However, they add to the difficulty
of natural language processing. Here we describe a procedure for
obtaining paraphrases from news articles. Articles derived from
different newspapers can contain paraphrases if it indeed report
the same event on the same day. We exploit these two feature by
using Named Entity recognition. Our approach is based on the
assumption that named entities are preserved across
paraphrases. We applied our method to articles of two domains and
obtained notable example.
</pre></blockquote>

<p> Queequeg (command name: <code>qq</code>) prints the following
results for the above document:

<p>
<font color=white><blockquote><table bgcolor=black>
<tr><td valign=top><code><strong>$ </strong>qq -Wall sample.txt</code></td>
<td valign=top></td></tr>
<tr><td valign=top><code>-- sample.txt</code></td>
<td valign=top></td></tr>
<tr><td valign=top><code>sample.txt:0: <font color="#ffff00"><strong>(S:Paraphrases) (V:plays)</strong></font> an important ...</code></td>
<td valign=top><i>(number disagreement between "paraphrases" and "plays")</i></td></tr>
<tr><td valign=top><code>sample.txt:0: ... variety and <font color="#ff0000"><strong>(complexity)</strong></font> of natural ...</code></td>
<td valign=top></td></tr>
<tr><td valign=top><code>sample.txt:2: ... difficulty of <font color="#ff0000"><strong>(natural language)</strong></font> processing .</code></td>
<td valign=top></td></tr>
<tr><td valign=top><code>sample.txt:4: ... paraphrases if <font color="#ffff00"><strong>(S:it)</strong></font> indeed <font color="#ffff00"><strong>(V:report)</strong></font> the same ...</code></td>
<td valign=top><i>(number disagreement between "it" and "report")</i></td></tr>
<tr><td valign=top><code>sample.txt:5: We exploit <font color="#00ff00"><strong>(Det:these two) (N:feature)</strong></font> by using ...</code></td>
<td valign=top><i>("feature" should be in plural form)</i></td></tr>
<tr><td valign=top><code>sample.txt:5: ... by using <font color="#ff0000"><strong>(Named Entity recognition)</strong></font> .</code></td>
<td valign=top></td></tr>
<tr><td valign=top><code>sample.txt:8: ... and obtained <font color="#ff0000"><strong>(notable example)</strong></font> .</code></td>
<td valign=top><i>(an article needed, or should be plural)</i></td></tr>
</table></blockquote></font>

<p> Different types of errors are shown in different colors.  A
number displayed at the beginning of each line is the line number
in a file.

<p> Currently Queequeg recognizes the following document formats:
plain text, LaTeX and HTML.

<h3>Download and Install</h3>

<h4>Prerequisite</h4>
<dl>
  <dt> <a href="http://www.python.org/">Python 2.3 or newer</a>
  <dd> The program is written in Python.
       You need version 2.2 or newer so that it works fine.
       
  <dt> <a href="http://wordnet.princeton.edu//">Wordnet 1.7.1</a>
  <dd> WordNet is a free online thesaurus developed by Prof. George Miller.
       <a href="http://packages.debian.org/unstable/text/wordnet.html">This package is now contained in Debian.</a>
       <br>
       (Queequeg uses only dictionary files included in WordNet distribution package,
       so you don't need to install the binaries.)
       
  <dt> <a href="http://pilcrow.madison.wi.us/#pycdb">python-cdb 0.32</a> (optional)
  <dd> Used for dictionary access. Queequeg works faster with this library.

</dl>

<h4>Download of the Program</h4>
<p>
Download the archive file in the follwing page. (about 60kbytes)
<ul>
  <li> <a href="http://sourceforge.net/project/showfiles.php?group_id=82185">http://sourceforge.net/project/showfiles.php?group_id=82185</a> (the newest version: 0.91)
</ul>

<h4>Installation</h4>

<ol>
  <li> Extract the archive file in an appropreate directory
       (e.g. <code>/usr/local/queequeg-0.9</code>).
  <li> Extract <a href="http://www.cogsci.princeton.edu/~wn/">Wordnet 1.7.1</a> package
       somewhere.
  <li> Build a system dictionary.
       Type at the top directory of Queequeg:
       <blockquote><code><strong>$</strong> make dict WORDNETDICT=<i>/src/wordnet/dict</i></code></blockquote>
       where the environment variable <code>WORDNETDICT</code> should be
       the pathname of the <code>dict/</code> directory in WordNet package.
       <br>
       (Note: If you're using a Debian package, the dictionaries are put in
       <code>/usr/share/wordnet</code>.)<br>
       If Python-cdb module is installed,
       a CDB type dictionary file <code>dict.cdb</code> is generated.
       Otherwise <code>dict.txt</code> is generated.
  <li> The main program is <code>qq</code>. Have your shell look into this path.
       You may create a symbolic link in some directory like <code>/usr/local/bin</code> to
       <code>qq</code>.
       (It tries to find a dictionary file located at the same directory.)
       
</ol>

<h3>How to Use</h3>

<p> Just feed Queequeg a file you want to check (command name:
<code>qq</code>).  It recognizes the document formats
automatically based on its extention (.tex, .html or .htm).

<p> Queequeg issues warnings based on the follwing types of
grammatical errors:

<ul>
  <li> <font color="#008000"><strong>GREEN</strong></font> ...
       Number disagreement between a noun group and its determiner.
       (e.g. "three desk", "a cups")
  <li> <font color="#808000"><strong>YELLOW</strong></font> ...
       Number disagreement between a subject and a verb.
       (e.g. "he drink a coffee.", "I wrote a book which make me rich.")
  <li> <font color="#800000"><strong>RED</strong></font> ...
       An arcitle is required.
       (e.g. "this is pen.")<br>
       (Note: Since this checking is rather fallacy and verbose,
       it is disabled by default. Give <code>-Wall</code> option to enable this feature.)
</ul>

<p> Also <code>qq</code> accepts the following command line
options:

<p>
<table border>
<tr><td><strong>Option</strong></td><td><strong>Feature</strong></td></tr>
<tr><td><code>-v</code></td>
<td>Verbose mode. It displays the name of errors.</td></tr>
<tr><td><code>-q</code></td>
<td>Quiet mode. It doesn't display file names.</td></tr>
<tr><td><code>-p</code></td>
<td>Force it to recognize all files as plain text format.
Each paragraph is separated with an empty line in plain text format.</td></tr>
<tr><td><code>-l</code></td>
<td>Force it to recognize all files as HTML format.</td></tr>
<tr><td><code>-t</code></td>
<td>Force it to recognize all files as LaTeX format.</td></tr>
<tr><td><code>-s <i>pathname</i></code></td>
<td>Specify the pathname of a system dictionary (dict.txt or dict.cdb).
By default, it tries to find a dictionary file located at the same directory.</td></tr>
</table>

<p>
The following options are for debugging purpose:
<table border>
<tr><td><strong>Option</strong></td><td><strong>Feature</strong></td></tr>
<tr><td><code>-D  <i>debuglevel</i></code></td>
f<td>Specify the debuglevel as integer.</td></tr>
<tr><td><code>-S  <i>stage</i></code></td>
<td>Specify the stage to which the process is performed.
The default is <code>grammar</code> (to check grammatical error).
Acceptable values are
<code>token</code> (tokenize input files),
<code>sentence</code> (split sentences),
<code>pos0</code> (pos tagging phase 1), or
<code>pos1</code> (pos tagging phase 2).
</td></tr>
<tr><td><code>-W  <i>type1,type2,...</i></code></td>
<td>Specify which type of errors should be checked.
Acceptable values are
<code>sv1</code> (a subject and a verb placed across a prepotitional phrase),
<code>sv2</code> (a subject and a verb placed adjacently),
<code>sv3</code> (a subject and a verb in "there-be" type syntax), or
<code>det</code> (determiner requirement),
<code>plural</code> (numbers of nouns).
Values should be separated with comma. 
The default is <code>sv1,sv2,sv3,plural</code>.
Value <code>all</code> is also accepted for specifying every type of errors.
</td></tr>
</table>

<h3>Why I get unreasonable results?</h3>

<p> The current version of Queequeg reports lots of false
positives which should not be reported generally.

<p> For example, a sentence "my paper clip" looks like consisting
of a noun phrase. But actually an error is reported since this can
also be regarded as "my paper clip[s]", where the last "s" is
missing.  Also, a noun phrase "three additional links" also
generates a number disagreement warning though, this is because a
singular noun called "links" is contained in a system dictionary
file.

<p> Determiner checking tends to generate more false positives,
because Queequeg don't know if a target noun is mass noun or not.
Normally, material names such as "meat" or "water", or abstract
nouns such as "information" need not take any article. However
WordNet doesn't have this kind of information.  (Some dictionaries
like COMLEX do have this, but I didn't use them because they
cannot be freely distributed.)

<hr>
<h3>Bugs and TODOs</h3> <ul>
  <li> Improve accuracy. Paranoia mode and normal mode should be separated.
  <li> Must support user dictionaries.
  <li> Warning for unknown words.
  <li> Change warning colors on terminal.
  <li> Ispell-like interface on Emacsen. Support Tkinter too.
  <li> Port to Windows.
  <li> Support collocation.
  <li> <code>setup.py</code>.
  <li> Source code comments.
  <li> Make it faster.
</ul>
       

<hr> <a name="tech"><h3>Technical Information</h3></a>

<p> Queequeg identifies grammatical errors with pattern
recognition based on simple finite automata (i.e. regexps) and
unification of features assigned on each portion of an expression.
It doesn't parse a sentence to earn speed and coverage.  The core
part of checking is done in <code>constraint.py</code> and
<code>unification.py</code>.

<p> POS tagging is performed in two phases.  First it looks up
dictionaries and obtains multiple candidates for each word
(<code>sentence.py, dictionary.py</code>), then tries to fix
several tags using regexp based pattern matching
(<code>postagfix.py</code>).

<p> We used a modified version of Penn Treebank tagset.  Plural
form of pronouns (PRPS) and determiners (DTS) are extended so that
Queequeg identifies the number of a noun group by looking the POS
tag assigned to each noun.

<P> Unlike other natural language systems, Queequeg cannot assume
a given sentence is grammatical. It decreases the accuracy of POS
tagging.
