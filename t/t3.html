<h2>Recursion and Generators</h2>

<p> <strong>Abstract:</strong> A certain kind of problems can be
described with recursive procedures quite efficiently.  But
sometime you need strict control over recursive procedures which
produces a huge amount of data, which adds difficulty to
coding. Python generators, which are available in Python 2.2 or
later, allows us to control these procedures easily preserving
concise programs.

<h3>Introduction</h3>

<p> No one doubts the power of recursion.  Although it sometime
might look a little bit complicated, it normally provides a quick
way to describe a solution.  This is especially true if the size
of data handled by a procedure grows exponentially.  Traversing a
tree is a good example.  Since each node in a tree has one or more
nodes, as the procedure goes down the tree, the number of nodes
grows in exponential order. But if all nodes are homogeneous, the
same procedure can apply to every node again and again.

<p> Tree traversal is a trivial example of recursion, because
almost every Computer Science textbook explains this.  Probably
everyone will happily choose recursion for tree traversal without
any deep consideration.  Of course however, there are many tasks
where recursion works pretty well. So let us take another example.

<p> Consider the following function <i>f</i> which takes a set of
vectors (<i>V<sub>1</sub></i>, <i>V<sub>2</sub></i>,
<i>V<sub>3</sub></i>, ... , <i>V<sub>n</sub></i>) and returns a
set of all possible combinations of each element of
<i>V<sub>i</sub></i>.  Each combination consists of
<i>n</i>-element vectors (<i>x<sub>i1</sub></i>, <i>x<sub>i2</sub></i>, ... ,
<i>x<sub>im</sub></i>) where <i>x<sub>ij</sub></i> is an element of
<i>V<sub>i</sub></i>. The total number of vectors this function
returns is |<i>V<sub>1</sub></i>| x |<i>V<sub>2</sub></i>| x
|<i>V<sub>3</sub></i>| x ... x |<i>V<sub>n</sub></i>|.

<p> Let us consider implementing this function in Python.  For
simplicity, we use String objects to represent each vector
<i>V<sub>i</sub></i>.  The function returns a set of vectors as a
list. The expected result is the following:

<blockquote><pre>
<strong>f([])</strong> --&gt; ['']  # 1
<strong>f(['abc'])</strong> --&gt; ['a', 'b', 'c']  # 3
<strong>f(['abc', 'xyz'])</strong> --&gt; ['ax', 'ay', 'az', 'bx', 'by', 'bz', 'cx', 'cy', 'cz']  # 9
<strong>f(['abc', 'xyz', '123'])</strong> --&gt; ['ax1', 'ax2', 'ax3', 'ay1', 'ay2', 'ay3', 'az1', 'az2', 'az3',
                              'bx1', 'bx2', 'bx3', 'by1', 'by2', 'by3', 'bz1', 'bz2', 'bz3',
                              'cx1', 'cx2', 'cx3', 'cy1', 'cy2', 'cy3', 'cz1', 'cz2', 'cz3']  # 27
</pre></blockquote>

<p> At a first glance, it looks easy to implement.  You might
think that this function can be written easily without using any
recursion. Let's try.

<h3>Solutions</h3>

<p>
First, if you don't want to use recursion at all, your program
might end up with something like this:

<h4>Non-recursive Version</h4>
<blockquote><pre>
<span class="PY_KEYWORD">def</span><a name="f0"><span class="PY_IDENTIFIER"> f0</span></a>(args):
  counter = [ 0 <span class="PY_KEYWORD">for</span> i <span class="PY_KEYWORD">in</span> args ]
  r = []
  <span class="PY_KEYWORD">while</span> 1:
    r.append(<span class="PY_STRING">""</span>.join([ arg1[i] <span class="PY_KEYWORD">for</span> arg1,i <span class="PY_KEYWORD">in</span> zip(args, counter) ]))
    carry = 1
    x = range(len(args))
    x.reverse()  <span class="PY_COMMENT"># x == [len(args)-1, len(args)-2, ..., 1, 0]</span>
    <span class="PY_KEYWORD">for</span> i <span class="PY_KEYWORD">in</span> x:
      counter[i] += 1
      <span class="PY_KEYWORD">if</span> counter[i] &lt; len(args[i]):
        carry = 0
        <span class="PY_KEYWORD">break</span> <span class="PY_COMMENT"># leave "for"</span>
      counter[i] = 0
    <span class="PY_KEYWORD">else</span>:
      <span class="PY_KEYWORD">break</span> <span class="PY_COMMENT"># leave "while"</span>
  <span class="PY_KEYWORD">return</span> r
</pre></blockquote>

<p> Without using recursion, you have to remember intermediate
states somehow to produce all possible solutions. In this program,
I tried to emulate something like full-adders. First the program
prepares a list of integers and then repeatedly attempts to add
one to the least significant digit. At each iteration, it
concatenates elements in each argument and put it into variable
<code>r</code>.  But the behavior of this program is not so
clear, even though some variable names such as
"<code>carry</code>" are suggestive.

<h4>Recursive Version</h4>

<p>
Now you have recursion. The function <i>f</i> can be defined
recursively as follows:

<p>
<table align=center>
<tr>
<td>f(<i>V<sub>i</sub></i>, <i>V<sub>i+1</sub></i>, ... , <i>V<sub>n</sub></i>) =</td>
<td>({<i>x<sub>i1</sub></i>} + f(<i>V<sub>i+1</sub></i>, ... , <i>V<sub>n</sub></i>)) +</td>
</tr><tr><td></td>
<td>({<i>x<sub>i2</sub></i>} + f(<i>V<sub>i+1</sub></i>, ... , <i>V<sub>n</sub></i>)) +</td>
</tr><tr><td></td>
<td>...</td>
</tr><tr><td></td>
<td>({<i>x<sub>im</sub></i>} + f(<i>V<sub>i+1</sub></i>, ... , <i>V<sub>n</sub></i>)) .</td>
</tr>
</table>

<p>
With this definition, you can make the program a much simpler by calling itself:

<blockquote><pre>
<span class="PY_KEYWORD">def</span><a name="fr"><span class="PY_IDENTIFIER"> fr</span></a>(args):
  <span class="PY_KEYWORD">if</span> <span class="PY_KEYWORD">not</span> args:
    <span class="PY_KEYWORD">return</span> [<span class="PY_STRING">""</span>]
  r = []
  <span class="PY_KEYWORD">for</span> i <span class="PY_KEYWORD">in</span> args[0]:
    <span class="PY_KEYWORD">for</span> tmp <span class="PY_KEYWORD">in</span> fr(args[1:]):
      r.append(i + tmp)
  <span class="PY_KEYWORD">return</span> r
</pre></blockquote>

<p> The implementation above is very straightforward.  The power
of recursion is that you can split the problem into several
subproblems and apply the exactly same machinery to each
subproblem.  This program simply takes the first element of each
argument and concatenate it with every solution of this function
with one fewer arguments (Fig 1).

<h3>More Solutions</h3>

<p> So far we have seen functions which return all the results at
a time. But in some applications such as searching or enumerating,
you probably don't want to remember all combinations.  What you
want to do is just to inspect one combination at each time, and
throw away after using it.

<p> When the number of outputs is small, this is not a big deal.
But what we expected for recursive procedures is to provide a
quick solution for functions whose result grows exponentially,
right?  Ironically, however, such functions tend to produce a huge
amount of data that cause problems in your program.  In many
language implementations, they cannot remember all the
results. Sooner or later it will reach the maximum limit of the
memory:

<blockquote><pre>
$ ulimit -v 5000
$ python
...
&gt;&gt;&gt; for x in fr(["abcdefghij","abcdefghij","abcdefghij","abcdefghij","abcdefghij"]):
...  print x
...
Traceback (most recent call last):
  File "&lt;stdin&gt;", line 1, in ?
  File "&lt;stdin&gt;", line 7, in fr
MemoryError
</pre></blockquote>

<p>
The typical solution for this is to split every combination into different states.
The typical way to do this in Python is to build an iterator.

<h4>Iterator Version</h4>

<p> In Python, a class which has a <code>__iter__</code> method
can be used as iterators. Although iterators are not functionally
identical to lists, they can be taken instead of lists in some
statements or functions (<code>for</code>, <code>map</code>,
<code>filter</code>, etc).

<blockquote><pre>
<span class="PY_KEYWORD">class</span><a name="fi"><span class="PY_IDENTIFIER"> fi</span></a>:
  <span class="PY_KEYWORD">def</span><a name="__init__"><span class="PY_IDENTIFIER"> __init__</span></a>(self, args):
    self.args = args
    self.counter = [ 0 <span class="PY_KEYWORD">for</span> i <span class="PY_KEYWORD">in</span> args ]
    self.carry = 0
    <span class="PY_KEYWORD">return</span>
  
  <span class="PY_KEYWORD">def</span><a name="__iter__"><span class="PY_IDENTIFIER"> __iter__</span></a>(self):
    <span class="PY_KEYWORD">return</span> self
  
  <span class="PY_KEYWORD">def</span><a name="next"><span class="PY_IDENTIFIER"> next</span></a>(self):
    <span class="PY_KEYWORD">if</span> self.carry:
      <span class="PY_KEYWORD">raise</span> StopIteration
    r = <span class="PY_STRING">""</span>.join([ arg1[i] <span class="PY_KEYWORD">for</span> arg1,i <span class="PY_KEYWORD">in</span> zip(self.args, self.counter) ])
    self.carry = 1
    x = range(len(self.args))
    x.reverse()  <span class="PY_COMMENT"># x == [len(args)-1, len(args)-2, ..., 1, 0]</span>
    <span class="PY_KEYWORD">for</span> i <span class="PY_KEYWORD">in</span> x:
      self.counter[i] += 1
      <span class="PY_KEYWORD">if</span> self.counter[i] &lt; len(self.args[i]):
        self.carry = 0
        <span class="PY_KEYWORD">break</span>
      self.counter[i] = 0
    <span class="PY_KEYWORD">return</span> r

<span class="PY_COMMENT"># display</span>
<span class="PY_KEYWORD">def</span><a name="display"><span class="PY_IDENTIFIER"> display</span></a>(x):
  <span class="PY_KEYWORD">for</span> i <span class="PY_KEYWORD">in</span> x:
    <span class="PY_KEYWORD">print</span> i,
  <span class="PY_KEYWORD">print</span>
  <span class="PY_KEYWORD">return</span>
</pre></blockquote>

<p> In this program, you can use the constructor of the class
<code>fi</code> in the same manner as the recursive version <code>fr</code> as in:

<blockquote><pre>
&gt;&gt;&gt; <strong>display(fi(["abc","def"]))</strong>
</pre></blockquote>

<p> When this instance is passed to a <code>for</code> statement,
the <code>__iter__</code> method is called and the returned object
(the object itself in this case) is used as the iterator of the
loop.  At each iteration, the <code>next</code> method is called
without argument and the return value is stored in the loop
variable.

<p> However, this program is not easy to understand.
Algorithmically, it is similar to the non-recursive version I
described above.  Each time <code>next</code> method is called, it
updates the current state stored in <code>counter</code> variable
and returns one result according to the current state. But it
looks even more complicated, since the method is designed to be
called in between a loop, which is not shown explicitly here.
Readers might be upset by seeing that it checks <code>carry</code>
variable at the top of the <code>next</code> procedure.  They have
to imagine an (invisible) loop outside this method to understand
this.

<h4>Generator Version</h4>

Now we have generators. The program gets much simpler:

<blockquote><pre>
<span class="PY_KEYWORD">def</span><a name="fg"><span class="PY_IDENTIFIER"> fg</span></a>(args):
  <span class="PY_KEYWORD">if</span> <span class="PY_KEYWORD">not</span> args:
    yield <span class="PY_STRING">""</span>
    <span class="PY_KEYWORD">return</span>
  <span class="PY_KEYWORD">for</span> i <span class="PY_KEYWORD">in</span> args[0]:
    <span class="PY_KEYWORD">for</span> tmp <span class="PY_KEYWORD">in</span> fg(args[1:]):
      yield i + tmp
  <span class="PY_KEYWORD">return</span>
</pre></blockquote>

Note that this is not only simpler than the iterator version, but
also even simpler than the original version with recursion.  With
generators, we can simply throw (or "yield") results once at a
time, and forget them after that.  It is just like printing
results to a stream device. You don't have to really care about
preserving states. All you have to do is just to produce all
results recklessly, and still you can have strict control over
that procedure.  This is what functional programmers call <q>lazy
evaluation</q>. Generators provide the same facility in a
different kind of form within a framework of procedural languages.


<h4>Lambda-encapsulation Version</h4>

<p> Perhaps functional programmers might prefer lambda
encapsulation rather than objects. Python also allows us to do
this. In fact, however, this was a real puzzle to me.  I could do
things in the same manner as I did the iterator version.  But I
wanted to do something different.  After hours of struggles, I
finally came up with something like this:

<blockquote><pre>
<span class="PY_KEYWORD">def</span><a name="fl"><span class="PY_IDENTIFIER"> fl</span></a>(args, i=0, tmp=<span class="PY_STRING">""</span>, parent_sibling=None):
  <span class="PY_KEYWORD">if</span> <span class="PY_KEYWORD">not</span> args:
    <span class="PY_COMMENT"># at a leaf</span>
    <span class="PY_KEYWORD">return</span> (tmp, parent_sibling)
  <span class="PY_KEYWORD">if</span> i &lt; len(args[0]):
    <span class="PY_COMMENT"># prepare my sibling</span>
    sibling = fl(args, i+1, tmp, parent_sibling)
    <span class="PY_KEYWORD">return</span> <span class="PY_KEYWORD">lambda</span>: fl(args[1:], 0, tmp+args[0][i], sibling)
  <span class="PY_KEYWORD">else</span>:
    <span class="PY_COMMENT"># go up and visit the parent's sibling</span>
    <span class="PY_KEYWORD">return</span> parent_sibling

<span class="PY_COMMENT"># traverse function for lambda version</span>
<span class="PY_KEYWORD">def</span><a name="traverse"><span class="PY_IDENTIFIER"> traverse</span></a>(n):
  <span class="PY_KEYWORD">while</span> n:
    <span class="PY_KEYWORD">if</span> callable(n):
      <span class="PY_COMMENT"># node</span>
      n = n()
    <span class="PY_KEYWORD">else</span>:
      <span class="PY_COMMENT"># leaf</span>
      (result, n) = n
      <span class="PY_KEYWORD">print</span> result,
  <span class="PY_KEYWORD">print</span>
</pre></blockquote>

<p> The idea is indeed to take it as tree traversal.  The function
<i>f</i> can be regarded as a tree which contains a partial result
at each node (Fig 2).  A function produced by <code>fl</code>
retains its position, the next sibling node, and the next sibling
of the parent node in the tree. As it descends the tree, the
elements of the vectors are accumulated. When it reaches at a leaf
it returns one combination.  If there is no node to traverse in
the same level, it goes back to the parent node and tries the next
sibling of the parent node.  We need a special driver routine to
traverse the tree.

<font size="-1">Fig 2. The Function <i>f</i> as Tree Traversal</font>
</center>

<p> Of course the generator version can be also regarded as tree
traversal.  In this case, you will be visiting a tree and dropping
a result at each node.
