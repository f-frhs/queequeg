Paraphrases plays an important role in the variety and complexity
of natural language documents. However, they add to the difficulty
of natural language processing. Here we describe a procedure for
obtaining paraphrases from news articles. Articles derived from
different newspapers can contain paraphrases if it indeed report
the same event on the same day. We exploit these two feature by
using Named Entity recognition. Our approach is based on the
assumption that named entities are preserved across
paraphrases. We applied our method to articles of two domains and
obtained notable example.
